Started looking at Scrapy for a refresh

Looked at authentication in Scrapy - needed HTTP auth rather than form filling
Made scraper more polite with autothrottle, download delays, name and http thing
For some reason elements in a certain table weren't accessible - no obvious solution online, resorting to url patterns
